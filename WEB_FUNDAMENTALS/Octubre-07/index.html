        <h2>Michael Schumacher</h2>
        <h5>Hürth-Hermülheim,Germany</h5>
        <p>
            Michael Schumacher is a retired German racing driver who raced in Formula One for Jordan, Benetton, Ferrari
            and Mercedes. He is a seven-time World Champion and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One
            drivers of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Schumacher was born in Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, to Rolf Schumacher, a bricklayer, and his wife
            Elisabeth. When Schumacher was four, his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine.
            When Schumacher crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents took him to the karting track at
            Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club.
